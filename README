Overview
--------

``jaraco.financial`` implements tools for financial management, particularly
around Open Financial Exchange and Microsoft Money. These scripts help
facilitate the continued use of Money using the free, sunset release, by
enabling mechanical downloads of OFX data from institutions that support OFX.

``jaraco.financial`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
`MIT-style permissive license

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.financial``, or grab the code
from the `mercurial repository
<https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.financial>`_.

Getting Started
---------------

The primary use of this package is the `ofx` command. After installing, run
`ofx --help` for usage. `jaraco.financial` doesn't provide any institutions,
but you can see `jaraco.institutions` for an example of a project that
implements some institutions for use in `jaraco.financial`.

This project is still a work in progress, but if you think you might find
it useful, don't hesitate to contact the author for help.

Planned Changes
---------------

The author plans to add some of the following features:

* Integrate some of the most common institutions.

Changes
-------

1.0
~~~

* `ofx` script now implements different commands. Where one called "ofx"
  before, now call "ofx query".
* Added new command "ofx download-all", which loads the accounts from a JSON
  file (~/Documents/Financial/accounts.json) and downloads transactions for
  the accounts listed in that file.
* Added command "record-document-hashes" for e-mailing record of the
  hashes of each document.

0.2
~~~

* Integrated OFX support based on scripts provided by Jeremy Jongsma. Includes
  ability to specify financial institutions as plugins and download OFX data
  via the command-line script `ofx`.
* Added keyring support, so credentials for financial institutions are stored
  securely within the Windows Vault.
* Added command to clean up temporary files that crash MS Money.

0.1
~~~

* Initial release with script for launching files in MS Money.
