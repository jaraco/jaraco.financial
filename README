Overview
--------

``jaraco.financial`` implements tools for financial management, particularly
around Open Financial Exchange and Microsoft Money. These scripts help
facilitate the continued use of Money using the free, sunset release, by
enabling mechanical downloads of OFX data from institutions that support OFX.

``jaraco.financial`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
`MIT-style permissive license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.financial``, or grab the code
from the `mercurial repository
<https://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.financial>`_.

Getting Started
---------------

The primary use of this package is the `ofx` command. After installing, run
`ofx --help` for usage. `jaraco.financial` doesn't provide any institutions,
but you can see `jaraco.institutions` for an example of a project that
implements some institutions for use in `jaraco.financial`.

This project is still a work in progress, but if you think you might find
it useful, don't hesitate to contact the author for help.

Planned Changes
---------------

The author plans to add some of the following features:

* Provide an input file format for specifying user's account details instead
  of requiring them to be passed as command-line parameters.
* Integrate some of the most common institutions.
